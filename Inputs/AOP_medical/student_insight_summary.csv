274600,64.0,0,Periodic Trends; Chemical Reactions; Human Physiology,Laws of Motion; Optics; Plant Physiology,The student exhibits a mix of conceptual and calculation errors. There's a tendency to misunderstand application of formulas and periodic trends. A lot of correct answers with high confidence.,"The student demonstrates a good understanding of core scientific principles but struggles with more complex applications and a small subset of conceptual physics and biology questions. Focused review of kinematics and optics formulas, periodic trend applications, and plant physiology is recommended. Student can focus on complex problems to increase their understanding."
253411,86.0,0,Chemical Reactions; Human Physiology; Periodic Trends,Reflection of Light; Work Done by a Force; Darwin's Theory of Evolution,"Shows some knowledge gaps in physics problems related to optics and work-energy theorem, also some confusion in reaction types.","The student demonstrates a good understanding of chemistry and biology concepts. However, there are weaknesses in physics, particularly related to optics and work. Some confusion exists in reaction types and other memory related concepts."
269000,68.0,0,Periodic Table; Chemical Reactions; Basic Human biology,Plant Biology; Refraction and Reflection; Thermoregulation,"The student has a good grasp of basic concepts but struggles with slightly more complex scenarios and specific details, especially calculation errors.","The student shows a good understanding of fundamental scientific concepts across various disciplines. However, there are some weaker areas, particularly in Plant Biology and some calculation areas. Targeted review in these areas, with a focus on more complex problems and attention to detail, will be beneficial."
