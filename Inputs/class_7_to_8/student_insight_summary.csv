9492280859,48.89,0,Cell Biology; Mixtures and elements; Units of Measurement,Atomic Structure; Mirror Reflection; Reasoning,"Primarily guessing when unsure of the answer, leading to incorrect responses across various topics.","The student demonstrates good understanding in some areas, particularly cell biology, mixtures/elements and unit conversions. However, they struggle with atomic structure, reflection in mirrors and reasoning questions, often resorting to guessing. Further study and practice in these weak areas is recommended."
273300,73.33,0,Cell Biology; Mixtures and Elements; Light Reflection,Units and Measurement; Atomic Structure; Reasoning,"Primarily guessing when unsure, as indicated by the 'Guess' mistake type across multiple incorrect answers.","The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic concepts in Cell Biology, Mixtures, Elements, and Light Reflection. However, they struggle with Units, Measurements, Atomic Structure, and reasoning based questions. There's a tendency to guess when uncertain, which impacts their overall score."
271100,55.56,0,General Science Knowledge; Mixtures; Mirror Optics,Units and Measurement; Cell biology; Numerical Aptitude,"Frequent guessing, potentially due to lack of understanding or time constraints.","The student demonstrates a mixed performance. They have a good grasp of some general science concepts. However, they struggle with Numerical aptitude questions and fundamental concept of cells, units and measurement. Suggesting a need for focused revision and practice in those areas."
268500,51.11,0,General Science facts; Basic Numerical problems; Mixture and alloy definitions,Letter arrangement; Unit conversions; Mirror properties,"The dominant mistake pattern is guessing, possibly due to unfamiliarity with the concepts being tested. Many incorrect answers across different topics.","The student demonstrates a mixed performance, with strengths in recalling facts and basic calculations, but struggles with more complex reasoning and problem-solving. There is a high frequency of incorrect answers suggesting the student may be guessing."
265000,46.67,0,Cell Biology; Plant Tissue; Mixture separation,Unit Conversion; Mirror Optics; Atomic Structure,"A tendency to make conceptual errors and guesses, particularly in Physics and Chemistry problems involving definitions, formulas, and unit conversions. There are also some errors in basic calculations and confusing scientific definitions.","The student shows a good understanding of some basic biology concepts, but struggles with physics and chemistry, especially quantitative problems and definitional knowledge. More focus is needed on mastering fundamental concepts and practicing problem-solving techniques."
721000,42.22,0,Reflection; Mixtures; Cell Structure,Atomic Structure; Unit Conversion; Algebra Simplification,"Primarily guesses due to lack of supporting solution text, suggesting gaps in foundational knowledge or test-taking strategies.","The student demonstrates a mixed performance with strengths in basic definitions and simple applications, but struggles with numerical problems, unit conversions, and more complex conceptual understanding. Many incorrect answers appear to be guesses."
262000,40.0,0,Cell Structure and Function; Mixtures and Separations; Tissues,Units and Measurement; Reflection; Atomic Structure,"The student appears to be guessing on many of the questions across various topics, suggesting a lack of understanding or familiarity with the material.","The student demonstrates a mixed performance, with strengths in biology-related topics but struggles in math, physics, and chemistry, often resorting to guessing. There is a need for increased understanding across a broad range of topics."
253800,26.67,0,Properties of plane mirror; Derived quantity; Elements; Vascular Tissues; Skeletal muscles; Plant cell wall,Mirror images; Atomic Structure; Cell Structure and Functions; Mixtures and Separations; Units and Measurement; Epithelial Tissue,"Conceptual misunderstandings are the dominant mistake pattern. Many questions were answered incorrectly due to confusion regarding definitions and basic principles in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.","Student shows a weakness in fundamental concepts across Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. There are several questions answered incorrectly due to misunderstanding of basic definitions and principles. More focus should be given to solidify conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization. Student seems to have some calculation error issues and likely guesses answers when unsure of the solution."
