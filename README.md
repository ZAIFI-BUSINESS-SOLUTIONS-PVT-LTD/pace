# Pace Analytics

This project automates the extraction and analysis of student exam data using LLMs.
It processes PDF question papers and solutions, and student response CSVs to generate insights.

## Folder Structure

- `input/`: Contains raw data (PDFs, CSVs) organized by class.
- `output/`: Stores processed JSON and CSV files, separated by phase.
- `src/`: Source code for the application.
  - `phase1/`: Data extraction and mechanical analytics.
  - `phase2/`: Qualitative analysis using LLMs.
  - `utils/`: Shared utilities for file loading and validation.
- `phase1.md` / `phase2.md`: Documentation for LLM prompts and logic.

## How to Run

### Phase 1
Executes extraction and mechanical analytics.
```bash
python -m src.phase1.extract_questionpaper
python -m src.phase1.extract_solution
python -m src.phase1.merge_data
python -m src.phase1.generate_csvs
```

### Phase 2
Executes LLM-based reasoning and qualitative analysis.
```bash
python -m src.phase2.packetize_students
python -m src.phase2.llm_runner
python -m src.phase2.build_phase2_csvs
```

**Note:** LLM prompts and logic are defined in phase1.md and phase2.md.
