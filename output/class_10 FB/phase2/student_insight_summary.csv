2625,77.78,0,Basic Arithmetic/Algebra; Unit Conversions; Cell Biology,Sequence problems; Rationalization; Atomic structure,"Several incorrect answers are likely due to guessing, as no solutions are provided to determine a pattern of error.","The student demonstrates a good grasp of fundamental concepts, but struggles with less familiar problem types, relying on guessing. Review of problem-solving strategies is suggested."
728,31.82,0,Units and Measurement; Cell Structure and Function; Prefixes,Series; Coding-Decoding; Aptitude,Primarily guesses due to lack of explanation in solutions. Difficulty with varied problem-solving questions.,"Student ID 728 shows strength in Units and Measurement and Cell Structure. Performance is inconsistent, primarily making guesses. Requires more focus on problem solving techniques and conceptual understanding."
271900,71.11,0,Cell Structure and Function; Chemical Bonding; Motion,Logical Reasoning; Units and Measurement; Plant Anatomy,"The dominant mistake pattern is guessing, likely due to lack of understanding or difficulty recalling the correct answer when no solution text is available.","Student demonstrates a good understanding of concepts related to cell structure and chemical bonding. However, struggles with logical reasoning and some physics and biology fundamentals, leading to frequent guessing when unsure of the answer."
267000,62.22,0,Atomic Structure; Motion; Cell Biology,Number Series; Matching; Algebra,"Student frequently guesses when unsure, particularly in mathematics and matching questions. Performance indicates rote memorization instead of conceptual understanding.","The student demonstrates a good grasp of basic chemistry and physics concepts, as well as some aspects of cell biology. However, the student struggles with number series, algebra and matching questions, often resorting to guessing. This suggests a need to focus on problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of underlying concepts instead of memorization alone."
271700,62.79,0,Motion; Atomic Structure; Cell Biology,Number Series; Prefixes and Dimensions; Tissues,"Frequent guessing, particularly when the solution text provides no explanation.","Student demonstrates a good grasp of some concepts but struggles with others, often resorting to guessing. More focus on understanding concepts and problem-solving strategies is needed, especially for questions without provided solutions."
257400,53.33,0,Motion; Atomic Structure; Prefix Order,Cell Biology; Tissues; Number Series,"Primarily guessing on questions, suggesting a lack of understanding of underlying concepts, particularly in Cell Biology and Tissues.","The student demonstrates a mixed performance. They show strength in motion questions and atomic structure but struggle with questions involving cell biology, tissues, and number series, often resorting to guessing. Further concept review is needed."
262800,53.33,0,Basic Physics; Basic Chemistry; Basic Math,Advanced Math; Cell Biology; Reasoning,"Frequent incorrect answers suggest reliance on guessing rather than conceptual understanding, especially when the solution is not provided.  Many biology/anatomy questions are wrong.","Student demonstrates a good grasp of basic science and math concepts but struggles with more complex problems, particularly in cell biology, advanced math and logical reasoning. The student is heavily relying on guessing. Focus on building conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills in weakest areas is needed."
263900,48.89,0,Atomic Structure; Motion; Cell Biology,Number Series; Reasoning; Prefixes and Dimensions; Tissues,The student is struggling with questions where no explanation is provided. The dominant mistake type for incorrect answers is 'Guess'.,"The student demonstrates a mixed performance, excelling in areas like Atomic Structure, Motion and Cell Biology, while struggling with Number Series, Reasoning, Prefixes and Dimensions and Tissues where a large number of guesses suggest a lack of understanding."
255800,36.36,0,Cell Biology; Motion; Atomic Structure,Reasoning; Physics Fundamentals; Chemical Formulae,Frequent guessing due to lack of understanding across various topics.,"The student demonstrates some strength in Cell Biology, Motion and Atomic Structure but struggles significantly across various subjects, relying heavily on guessing. Focused review and practice across a wider range of topics is needed."
256000,31.11,0,,,The student's dominant mistake pattern is 'Guess'. Almost all incorrect answers are categorized as guesses due to a lack of explanation and seemingly random incorrect choices.,The student has a low performance on this test. The student seems to be guessing on many questions. Need to understand key concepts across subjects.
256100,27.27,0,Cell Biology; Meristematic tissues; Physical Quantities,Number Series; Prefixes; Ions,"Frequent guessing, indicating a lack of understanding or familiarity with many of the concepts tested. Lack of reasoning ability and understanding of fundamental concepts.","The student demonstrates a weak understanding across various subjects, with a tendency to guess answers. There are some areas of strength in Biology, but a broad review of all topics is needed."
