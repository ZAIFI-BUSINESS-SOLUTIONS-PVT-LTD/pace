32245,77.78,0,Cell Biology; Atomic Structure; Motion,Units and Measurement; General Science; Numerical Ability,The student seems to guess when they don't know the answer. There are a few areas where the student needs conceptual clarity.,"The student demonstrates good understanding of core concepts, but there are multiple guess answers. Needs to focus on understanding the fundamental concepts of 'Units and Measurement', 'General Science', and 'Numerical Ability'."
748000,75.56,0,Basic arithmetic/sequence reasoning; Application of formulae; Basic biology,"Kinematics and motion; Isotopes, reducing agent; Osmosis/Exosmosis","Primarily conceptual errors indicate a lack of fundamental understanding in certain areas of Physics and Chemistry, and Biology.","The student demonstrates a good grasp of basic arithmetic concepts and formulae applications. However, there are notable weaknesses in Physics, Chemistry and Biology."
265300,73.33,0,Cell Biology; Basic Calculations; Identification of structures,Prefixes in ascending order; Average Velocity; Plasmolysis,The dominant mistake pattern appears to be a misunderstanding of core concepts and guessing when unsure.,The student demonstrates a good understanding of cell biology and basic calculations but struggles with core physics/chemistry concepts. There are several instances of what appears to be guessing. Further study of the fundamental concepts is recommended.
267200,73.33,0,Cell Biology; Atomic Structure; Motion,Number Series; Prefixes of Units; Unit of Power,Frequent guessing when faced with numerical problems or questions requiring reasoning. The student needs to improve their problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.,"The student demonstrates a good grasp of fundamental concepts in Cell biology, atomic structure and motion. However, they struggle with numerical problems and concepts requiring more in-depth reasoning and tend to guess. Further focus should be given to improve problem solving."
411503,73.33,0,Cell Biology; Atomic Structure; Tissue types,Number series; Units and Measurement; Kinematics,"Conceptual errors are the dominant mistake pattern, particularly in physics and chemistry. Also, some 'Guess' errors due to lack of explanation.","The student demonstrates a good understanding of cell biology, atomic structure and tissue types. There are several conceptual gaps in physics and chemistry. The student also seems to be guessing in some questions."
285500,66.67,0,Cell Biology; Motion; Measurements,Number Series; Isotopes; Valency and Oxidation Number,"The student appears to guess frequently when unsure, leading to incorrect answers. This is particularly noticeable when no explanation is provided in the solution text.","The student demonstrates a good understanding of cell biology, motion, and measurements. However, they struggle with number series, isotopes, and valency/oxidation number concepts. The student needs to avoid guessing and spend more time understanding the fundamentals."
286600,50.0,0,Momentum; Motion Graphs; Number System,Atomic Structure; Plant Physiology; Cell Biology,"Frequent guessing, especially in questions without provided solutions, leads to incorrect answers. This indicates a lack of conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills.","The student demonstrates a mixed performance. While they show competency in some areas, there's a notable tendency to guess on questions where they lack clear understanding. A focus on building foundational knowledge and problem-solving strategies is recommended."
279500,44.44,0,UNKNOWN; UNKNOWN; UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN; UNKNOWN; UNKNOWN,"The student's dominant mistake pattern is guessing.  Due to lack of solution texts, no specific conceptual weaknesses can be determined.",The student demonstrates variable performance. The student seems to be guessing a lot of answers. More in-depth analysis of student's reasoning can be achieved by providing detailed solutions.
