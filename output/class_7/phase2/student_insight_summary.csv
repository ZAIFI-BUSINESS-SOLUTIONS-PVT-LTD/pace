275200,73.33,0,General Knowledge; Water Properties; Plant Basics,"SI Units; Plant Systems; Basic Definitions (Reproduction, Habitat)","The student struggles with applying definitions and concepts related to natural sciences, particularly in biology and physics. Mistakes include misinterpreting relationships between plant structures, misidentifying base SI units, and confusing related terms like reproduction and growth.","The student generally performs well on easy and medium-difficulty questions. However, the student shows confusion with definitions and relationships in hard-difficulty science questions. The student's errors are generally conceptual rather than calculation-based, with the exception of unit conversions."
276400,77.78,0,,,"The student makes errors in numerical conversions and some conceptual questions, particularly those tagged as 'Hard'.",The student demonstrates competence on 'Easy' and 'Medium' difficulty questions but struggles with 'Hard' difficulty questions. These difficulties are primarily in unit conversions and correctly applying concepts.
285800,51.11,0,"Basic definitions in biology (e.g., flower parts, habitats); Simple identification (e.g., mirror images); Basic properties of water; Coding/decoding","Unit conversions; Properties of water (boiling/freezing points, density); Ecology (biotic/abiotic factors); Number theory","The student makes errors involving calculations or conceptual misunderstandings related to scientific concepts, particularly those involving unit conversions and properties of matter.","The student demonstrates proficiency in basic definitions and simple identifications, particularly in biology and basic math. However, the student struggles with questions requiring multi-step calculations and scientific concepts, often selecting incorrect answers despite attempting all questions."
285900,51.11,0,"Identifying definitions (e.g., umbra, condensation); Identifying true/false statements","Unit conversions; Properties of water (e.g., effect of impurities, density); Plant anatomy and physiology; Coding/Decoding","The student makes frequent errors related to unit conversion and misidentifying concepts related to water, plants and coding problems.",The student demonstrates strong understanding of basic definitions but struggles with numerical problems involving unit conversions and also with some plant and water related concepts. A weaker understanding of reverse coding is evident.
