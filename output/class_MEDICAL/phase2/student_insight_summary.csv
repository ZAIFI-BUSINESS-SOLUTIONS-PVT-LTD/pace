274600,80.0,0,Balancing Chemical Equations; Periodic Table Trends; Life Processes,Aerobic Respiration; Parasitic Nutrition; Digestion,"The student frequently guesses incorrectly, especially in Biology and Physics questions, suggesting a lack of conceptual understanding or careless reading of the questions.","The student demonstrates a good understanding of several core concepts across Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. However, there are clear weaknesses in specific areas, notably biology and physics, where a significant portion of incorrect answers appear to be guesses. Further targeted study in these areas is recommended."
253411,72.0,0,Chemical Reactions; Periodic Table; Life Processes,Laws of Motion; Reflection and Refraction; Evolution,Primarily guesses when unsure; struggling with physics concepts and some biological relationships.,"The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic chemistry and some biology concepts. However, they struggle with physics, especially with questions requiring calculations or applying fundamental principles. A tendency to guess suggests a lack of confidence in certain topics."
269000,64.0,0,Balancing equations; Chemical reactions; Periodic table trends,Work energy theorem; Reflection of light; Aerobic respiration,"The student has a tendency to guess when unsure, as evidenced by several incorrect answers with no clear calculation or conceptual error.","The student demonstrates a mix of strengths and weaknesses across physics, chemistry, and biology. While some concepts are well understood, there's a clear reliance on guessing when faced with unfamiliar problems, suggesting a need for more in-depth study and problem-solving practice."
