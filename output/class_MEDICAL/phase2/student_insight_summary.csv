Additionally, they struggle with core definitions in Biology and Chemistry, which leads to mistakes based on conceptual misunderstandings.","The student's performance is characterized by stronger recall of basic definitions and concepts, especially in Biology and Chemistry. However, they demonstrate a notable weakness in applying physics formulas and performing accurate calculations, which results in incorrect answers on quantitative problems. The student also needs to improve their understanding of concepts in Chemistry."

They also confuse similar concepts in chemistry and biology. They tend to select an incorrect option, suggesting a partial understanding but not a comprehensive mastery of the material.","The student demonstrates inconsistent performance across subjects. They struggle with the application of quantitative physics principles and certain chemical concepts, particularly redox reactions, while showing a better grasp of basic life science facts and balancing chemical equations. The student also has difficulty consistently interpreting conceptual details within a subject."
