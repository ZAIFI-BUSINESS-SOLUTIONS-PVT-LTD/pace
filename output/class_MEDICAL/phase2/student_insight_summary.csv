287200,82.0,0,Balancing Equations; Neutralization reactions; Plant Reproduction,Periodic trends; Metalloids identification; Newton's Laws of Motion,"The student's incorrect answers seem to stem from guessing, as no solutions were provided. This points to knowledge gaps, particularly in Physics and Chemistry.","The student demonstrates a good grasp of basic Biology and some aspects of Chemistry. However, there are notable weaknesses in Physics and some Chemistry topics. The student needs to focus on strengthening their understanding of core concepts in those areas."
279000,66.0,0,Chemical Reactions; Periodic Table Trends; Life Processes,Work and Energy; Laws of Motion; Light and Reflection,Multiple questions are incorrect with no pattern observed as the solutions were unavailable; Likely guesses.,"Student performs well on Chemistry and Biology questions, but shows weaknesses in Physics concepts. Requires review of Physics topics."
754000,46.94,0,Basic Biology facts; Balancing chemical equations; Periodic Table basics,Physics Numerical Problems; Periodic Trends; Chemical Reactions,"Frequent incorrect answers suggest guessing, likely due to knowledge gaps across multiple subjects.","The student demonstrates strengths in recall of basic biological facts but struggles with numerical problem-solving in Physics, and applying principles in Chemistry and Biology. There is a pattern of guessing in areas of weakness."
276200,36.0,0,Neutralisation reaction; Photophosphorylation; Asexual reproduction,Momentum; Metalloids; Blood clotting,The dominant mistake pattern is guessing due to the lack of explanations and high number of incorrect answers. ,"The student has a very low performance, particularly with questions requiring calculations. The student excels primarily in rote memorization based questions."
