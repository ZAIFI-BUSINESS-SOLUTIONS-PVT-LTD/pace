class_10,"Students struggle with applying fundamental physics and chemistry concepts, particularly when solving numerical problems.",There is a tendency to guess answers instead of applying problem-solving strategies or seeking clarification.,Understanding of units of measurement and number series concepts is weak across the class.,"Incorporate more worked examples of physics and chemistry problems, emphasizing the underlying principles and problem-solving steps.","Implement strategies to discourage guessing, such as ""think-pair-share"" or requiring students to explain their reasoning before providing an answer.","Dedicate specific lessons to reinforce unit conversions, prefixes, and number series patterns, focusing on real-world applications."
class_7,Students struggle with applying learned concepts to solve problems and require a deeper understanding of underlying principles.,Unit conversions and related calculations are a significant area of difficulty.,"There is a tendency to guess when unsure, especially in math and general science questions.",Incorporate more problem-solving activities that require students to apply concepts in varied contexts.,"Dedicate additional time and practice to unit conversions, emphasizing real-world applications and step-by-step problem-solving strategies.","Encourage students to articulate their reasoning, even when unsure, to identify specific points of confusion rather than guessing."
class_9,"Many students struggle with the abstract concepts within wave properties, atomic theory (Dalton's), and cell biology.","Students exhibit guessing behavior, particularly in physics and mathematics, indicating a lack of confidence or strategy when facing unfamiliar problems.","Students demonstrate difficulty with unit conversions and applying formulas, suggesting a gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.","Dedicate class time to hands-on activities and real-world examples that illustrate wave properties, atomic structure, and cellular functions.","Model problem-solving strategies and encourage students to show their work, providing feedback on their approach rather than just the final answer.",Incorporate regular practice with unit conversions and formula application in diverse contexts to build fluency and confidence.
class_engineering,Polynomials are a widespread area of difficulty for students in this class.,Students are struggling with applying learned concepts to word problems.,Students frequently resort to guessing when they are unsure how to solve a problem.,Dedicate class time to in-depth examples and practice problems focused on polynomial concepts and manipulations.,"Incorporate more word problems into lesson plans, emphasizing strategies for translating text into mathematical expressions.","Model problem-solving strategies explicitly, demonstrating how to approach unfamiliar problems instead of guessing."
class_medical,"Physics concepts, particularly those involving calculations and problem-solving, are a widespread area of difficulty.",Applying learned concepts and principles in both Chemistry and Biology is challenging.,"Students are frequently resorting to guessing, indicating gaps in foundational knowledge across multiple subjects.","Incorporate more worked examples and practice problems in Physics, emphasizing step-by-step solutions.",Design activities that require students to apply Chemistry and Biology concepts to real-world scenarios.,Regularly review fundamental concepts and provide opportunities for low-stakes knowledge checks to identify and address gaps early.
