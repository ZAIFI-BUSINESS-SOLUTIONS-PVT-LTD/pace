275200,73.33,0,Properties of Water; Basic Conversions; Light Sources; Plant Parts,SI Units; Plant Root and Leaf Systems; Habitat and Adaptation; Definitions of Biological Processes,"The student demonstrates a mix of conceptual misunderstandings and errors in numerical calculation, particularly in Hard and Medium difficulty questions.","The student generally performs well on easier questions, but has difficulty with harder questions involving both calculations and conceptual knowledge. The student shows inconsistent understanding of plant biology and struggles with unit conversions and application of SI units."
276400,77.78,0,Basic definitions and easy factual recall; Plant biology,Unit conversions; Spatial reasoning (shadows); Properties of water,Incorrect unit conversions and misinterpreting conceptual definitions account for most errors.,"The student generally answers easy and medium-difficulty questions correctly, demonstrating a good grasp of basic concepts. However, the student makes errors on hard-difficulty questions involving unit conversions and definitions."
285800,51.11,0,Identifying characteristics and components of plants; Basic definitions of science; Correctly answering easy question,SI units and conversions; Properties of Water; Direction Based Questions,"Frequently makes mistakes when converting units or with complex scientific definitions, even when given formulas. Often misinterprets word problems or fails to recognize the direct application of formulas.","The student performs well on easier questions and definitions. The student struggles to perform conversions and interpret questions, getting many medium and hard level questions wrong. "
285900,51.11,0,Basic definitions; Light; Plant identification; Habitat identification,Unit conversions; Definitions related to water; Reasoning; Coding,The student struggles with conceptual questions that require definitions or reasoning and calculation-based questions involving unit conversions.,"The student demonstrates a good grasp of simpler concepts, particularly in biology and basic identification. However, the student makes errors frequently on numerical problems and questions requiring abstract reasoning or precise definitions."
